## License

The reason for selecting the [AGPL v3.0](https://github.com/virtualgis/maple/blob/master/LICENSE) as our open source license is to require that enhancements to Maple be released to the community. Traditional GPL often does not achieve this anymore as a huge amount of software runs in the cloud.

If use of the AGPL v3 does not satisfy your organizationâ€™s legal department (some will not approve GPL in any form), commercial licenses are available. Feel free to [contact us](mailto:info@virtualgis.io) for more details.
